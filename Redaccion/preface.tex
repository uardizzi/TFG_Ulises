This template uses a separate file for each section of your ETDR:
title page, abstract, preface, chapters, reference, etc.  This
makes it easier to organize and work with a lengthy document.  The
template is configured with page margins required by the Graduate
School and will automatically create a table of contents, lists of
tables and figures, and PDF bookmarks.

Although the template gives you a foundation for creating your
ETDR, you will need a working knowledge of LaTeX in order to
produce a final document.  You should be familiar with LaTeX
commands for formatting text, equations, tables, and other
elements you will need to include in your ETDR.
